# Changelog

All notable changes to Ronnie 3000 are in this file. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- An Archetype-style layout, opened with `ronie --layout archetype`. It has a light window
  whose header shows the signal chain as gear icons, with a + to add a block and the preset
  manager on the right. The selected block fills the stage, the global controls sit in a light
  panel, and a black utility bar holds the tuner, mono and stereo, undo and redo, account and
  settings. The current layout stays the default.
- Tiles without artwork show the gear family of their capture (for example a chime combo, a
  British head, a 4x12 or a green overdrive), recognised from the capture's name, its
  TONE3000 makes, or the make and model in the `.nam` file.

### Fixed

- `.nam` files imported from disk lost their gear type, because Ronnie read the metadata
  from the wrong place. Ronnie now also keeps their make, model and tone type.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-11

The first public release.

### Added

- Play Neural Amp Modeler (`.nam`) captures of amps, pedals, and full rigs with a native Rust
  engine. Choose LITE or FULL model size for each block.
- Load impulse responses (`.wav`) for cabinets and rooms.
- Build a signal chain of pedals, amps, and cabinets. Run two lanes in stereo with Spread,
  double-track Offset, Auto Balance, and Align.
- Shape the sound with a noise gate, a three-band tone stack, and a parametric EQ with a live
  spectrum.
- Shift the pitch by up to ±24 semitones. Pick a tuning (Eb Standard, D Standard, and more) for 6- and
  7-string guitar and 4- and 5-string bass. Use a MIDI expression pedal for whammy sweeps.
- Tune with the built-in chromatic tuner.
- Browse, search, and filter the TONE3000 community library. Favorite tones and download them;
  they stay available offline.
- Connect your own TONE3000 account in the app with your personal API key.
- Save and load presets as plain files that you can back up and share.
- Map MIDI pedals and knobs to controls.
- OPTIMIZE keeps the delay as low as your system allows: it picks the pitch window for your
  instrument, sizes the input queue and the device buffer, and shows the estimated delay.
- Calibrate the input level in dBu, and normalize each block.
- Oversample 2x, 4x, or 8x for less aliasing.
- Use PipeWire, PulseAudio, ALSA, or JACK on Linux.
- Undo and redo every edit. Use the keyboard and a screen reader.
- Install on Linux with an AppImage, a tarball, or a one-line script. Experimental builds for
  macOS and Windows.
