//! Background catalog work for one community service.
//!
//! [`CommunityWorker`] runs the catalog, taxonomy, favorite, and user requests on a runtime that
//! the caller names, and [`CommunityWorker::poll`] takes what finished without blocking. Only
//! the newest work of each kind stays live. A superseded or cancelled task has no live ticket,
//! so its output goes nowhere, even when the task finished before the poll.
//!
//! The token store does blocking file I/O, and a refresh rotates a token that the server
//! forgets. [`OffThreadTokens`] therefore runs each token lookup on a blocking thread. The
//! lookup does not stop the runtime threads, and an abort of its caller does not lose a rotated
//! token.
//!
//! A tone load and a model switch also change the audio chain, which a ticket from the load flow
//! guards. A cancellation that aborts a task cannot stop a compile, so the ticket has the last
//! word. Both kinds share one compile at a time.
//!
//! An event carries public results, generations, and fixed failure text. No event carries a
//! token, a response body, or a request URL. A model list holds the public model addresses that
//! the service gave.
